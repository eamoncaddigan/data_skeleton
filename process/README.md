This folder contains scripts that process raw data. In my analyses, I usually create a database that contains raw and processed data. The scripts that load this data into the database lives here. Each file name should begin with a number indicating the order in which it was created and run so that somebody else (e.g., future you) can reproduce the database and analysis.
